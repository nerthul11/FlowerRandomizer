# Flower Randomizer

A Hollow Knight Randomizer add-on for flower quest lovers.

## Settings

These are very straightforward. You can normally bring Delicate Flowers to various NPCs around Hallownest. This mods transforms that action into a location that will grant you a random item instead! Of course, since the difficulty and/or annoyance of each can vary a lot, the settings allow you to manually choose which NPCs should be included and which shouldn't.

- Vanilla NPCs:
 - Elderbug, whom you will not ignore for once.
 - Oro, the Nailmaster at Kingdom's Edge who teaches you Dash Slash.
 - Godseeker, keep in mind you need to actually defeat two Pantheons for this one.
 - Emilitia, the lady at the house in City of Tears that's locked from the inside. She rejects the flower, but gives you a gift anyway.
 - White Lady, the queen.

Additionally, some other places that you normally don't deliver flowers to can receive a flower now. Marissa will always be alive if you have a flower in your inventory (but will stay dead after you leave the room if you murdered her). Apparently the Pale King always respawns on the throne on rando runs, or at least I failed to replicate cases where he doesn't. Here's a list for those:

- Custom NPCs:
 - Sheo, the Nailmaster who teaches Great Slash, doesn't take flowers in vanilla but we can fix that.
 - Mato, the guy at Howling Cliffs, far from the world.
 - Marissa, who adores to sing. If you killed her, don't worry, bringing her a flower will bring her back to life, at least for a short while.
 - Midwife, the spider thing who jumpscares you on Deepnest.
 - Isma, carrying the flower to Isma's Grove will grant you a check.
 - Radiance, bring the flower to the Radiance's Statue on Hallownest's Crown for a check.
 - Pale King, carrying the flower to the Pale King at the top of White Palace will grant a check.
 - Pain, you know what it is, and if you don't, leave the setting off for your own good.

For those who want to do some flower quests on the run, but want to leave which ones will appear to chance, there's the "Randomize Quests at Start" setting. This will only randomize options from NPCs that are enabled (IE, if you leave Pain off and randomize quests at start, that particular quest will never appear on the save file)

- Randomize Quests at Start:
 - Minimum Quests, defines the minimum number of flower quests that will appear.
 - Maximum Quests, defines the maximum number of flower quests that will appear.

## Known issues

I could detect a few issues with other connections, will list them (and their solutions) here:

- Lore Randomizer:
 - If Isma flower is randomized, Isma's dream dialogue -if also randomized- will be removed from the location pool. If Pale Court is on, only the gods know what will happen. Don't use together.
 - If Radiance statue flower is randomized, its dream dialogue -if also randomized- will be removed from the location pool.
 - If Pale King flower is randomized, its dream dialogue -if also randomized- will be removed from the location pool.
- RandoPlus Ghost Essence:
 - A visual glitch happens when dream nailing Marissa if both mods are on. It has no gameplay consequences.
